# 🛠️ coach-scope-starter

A lightweight, coach-friendly toolkit to turn bold ideas into scoped prototypes.  
Includes a ChatGPT co-pilot prompt for defining your MVP — without the burnout.

## ✨ What This Is

This is for all types of founders, dreamers, and builder-coaches who need to:
- Make their bold idea *real*, without drowning in complexity
- Scope a tiny, testable prototype before overcommitting
- Use ChatGPT like a strategic tech buddy (not a vague vibe machine)

It’s designed to work inside a creative flow — low lift, high clarity.
