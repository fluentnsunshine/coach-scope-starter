### ✨ Bonus Tool: Life Project Realignment  
Use this [reflection schema](./life-project-eval-schema.json) to evaluate where your energy’s going — and whether to water it, prune it, or let it rest.  

{
  "project": "Life Project Evaluation & Realignment",
  "purpose": "This tool is for personal use — to check in on where your energy is going, what’s worth keeping, and what needs to go back on the altar. Use it to make grounded, clear decisions that honor your time, your capacities, your gifts, and the pace that actually sustains you.",
  "instructions": {
    "mindset": [
      "This is not a self-drag — it’s a self-alignment. Be honest, not harsh.",
      "Time is sacred. You don’t have to do it all, but you *do* deserve clarity on what’s worth it.",
      "Let go of projects that aren’t feeding your purpose, your peace, or your paycheck.",
      "Bring in both your strategist brain *and* your soul gut. You already know.",
      "Use the lens of power: Does this project give you more or less of it?",
      "Review with care. If you're stuck, imagine talking to your favorite future self — what would they say to protect your magic?"
